This directory contains the test suite I use to check the performance.
The shell script dotest will run the tests. Tests with an n in the name
of the file involve noise, so the results will vary from run to run. By
default dotest performs these 16 times, and list of values is printed.

For convenience, two small c programmes are included. ah.c calculates
the voltage expected on an RSJ junction using the Ambegoakar-Halperin
solution. rt.c checks the properties of one of the system's random
number generators. You can set which one to use by defining an appropriate
symbol at compilation. See the source for details.
